#Phrases

a blessing in disguise
a finger in every pie
a hot commodity
a hot mess
a lot on your plate
a piece of cake
a tall order
a watched pot never boils
all your eggs in one basket
apple of my eye
apple pie order
as easy as pie
as fresh as a daisy
as good as gold
as sweet as honey
at the drop of a hat
bad apple
best thing since sliced bread
bite the bullet
bite the dust
bite the hand that feeds you
bite your tongue
bread and butter
bread crumbs
bread on the water
breadwinner
bring home the bacon
bring something to the table
bring to the boil
burn bridges
burn the candle at both ends
burn the midnight oil
burn your bridges
butter someone up
buy a lemon
can't judge a book by its cover
cast iron stomach
cherry on top
cherry-pick
chew the fat
churn butter
clean your plate
close but no cigar
close, but no cigar
cook something up
cook the books
cook up a storm
cook's tour
cooked to a turn
cooked to perfection
cooking up a feast
cool as a cucumber
cry over spilled milk
crying over spilled milk
cup of joe
cup of tea
cut and dried
cut it fine
cut the mustard
dig in
dish out
don't cry over spilled milk
don't put all your eggs in one basket
down to the wire
easy as pie
eat crow
eat like a bird
eat like a pig
eat out of house and home
eat your cake
eat your heart out
eat your words
fish or cut bait
fish out of water
food for thought
full plate
full-bodied
get a second wind
get your just desserts
go bananas
going to the dogs
good as new
good enough to eat
half-baked idea
have a finger in every pie
have a sweet tooth
have your cake and eat it too
hot off the grill
hot potato
hot under the collar
icing on the cake
in a jam
in a nutshell
in a pickle
in the bag
in the soup
it's a wrap
jump on the bandwagon
jumping the gun
kitchen sink
last but not least
let the cat out of the bag
let's taco 'bout it
like a hot knife through butter
like a moth to a flame
like shooting fish in a barrel
like two peas in a pod
like watching paint dry
live high off the hog
made from scratch
make ends meet
meat and potatoes
milk it for all it's worth
more than you can chew
no picnic
no thyme like the present
nothing to sneeze at
nothing to write home about
nutty as a fruitcake
on the back burner
on the grill
paint the town red
pie in the sky
piece of the action
piece of the pie
pour oil on troubled waters
put the cart before the horse
put your money where your mouth is
rolling in dough
salt and pepper
salt of the earth
sell like hotcakes
smell a rat
soaked to the skin
something's fishy
soup to nuts
sour grapes
spice it up
spice of life
spice things up
spill the beans
stew in your own juice
sweet as pie
sweeten the deal
sweeten the pot
take it with a grain of salt
taste buds
taste of your own medicine
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
the big cheese
the cream rises to the top
the last straw
the proof is in the pudding
the whole enchilada
the whole shebang
too good to be true
too many cooks in the kitchen
turnip the beet
under the weather
use your noodle
walking on eggshells
what's cooking?
whole new ballgame
you are what you eat
you can't have your cake and eat it too
